# Robot-Arm-Circuit
- The robot arm has five joints, so we need five servo motors and five potentiometers. The potentiometer controls the angle of the servo motor.
- I used the Tinkercad Circuits tool to easily simulate the robot arm circuit with Arduino.

- The potentiometers are connected to analog pins: A0 to A4
- The servos are connected to digital pins: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10
- The values of analog input pins are ranging from 0 to 1023, and I want the servo value to be from 0 to 90
- I used the map() function so that the possible values of the angle are from 0 to 90
